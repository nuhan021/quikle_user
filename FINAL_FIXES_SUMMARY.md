# Final Fixes Summary - Product ID and Shop Integration

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Store vs Shop Consistency**

- **Issue**: Store and Shop were used interchangeably
- **Solution**: Unified everything to use "Shop" terminology
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `StoreModel` completely
  - Updated `ProductController` to use `ShopModel` instead of `StoreModel`
  - Updated `StoreInfoWidget` to use `shop` parameter instead of `store`
  - Changed service method from `getStoreInfo()` to `getShopInfo()`

### 2. **Reviews Need Product ID Connection**

- **Issue**: Reviews weren't linked to specific products
- **Solution**: Added `productId` field to `ReviewModel`
- **Changes**:
  ```dart
  class ReviewModel {
    final String id;
    final String productId;  // âœ… NEW: Links review to specific product
    final String userId;
    // ... other fields
  }
  ```
- **Service Update**: All reviews now include the product ID they belong to

### 3. **Questions Need Product ID Connection**

- **Issue**: Questions weren't linked to specific products
- **Solution**: Added `productId` field to `QuestionModel`
- **Changes**:
  ```dart
  class QuestionModel {
    final String id;
    final String productId;  // âœ… NEW: Links question to specific product
    final String userId;
    // ... other fields
  }
  ```
- **Service Update**: All questions now include the product ID they belong to

### 4. **Model Completeness**

- **Issue**: Models were missing proper structure and helper methods
- **Solution**: Added complete model implementation
- **Changes**:
  - Added `timeAgo` getter to both `ReviewModel` and `QuestionModel`
  - Proper date handling with human-readable time differences
  - Completed model constructors and required fields

## âœ… **Data Structure Now**

### **Product â†’ Reviews Relationship**

```dart
// Each review is linked to a specific product
ReviewModel(
  id: 'review_1',
  productId: 'food_1',  // Links to specific product
  userId: 'user_1',
  userName: 'Aaradhya Sharma',
  rating: 5.0,
  comment: 'Great product!',
  date: DateTime.now(),
)
```

### **Product â†’ Questions Relationship**

```dart
// Each question is linked to a specific product
QuestionModel(
  id: 'question_1',
  productId: 'food_1',  // Links to specific product
  userId: 'user_4',
  userName: 'Pooja Verma',
  question: 'May I order more than 1 kg?',
  answer: 'Yes, you can order multiple quantities.',
  date: DateTime.now(),
)
```

### **Product â†’ Shop Relationship**

```dart
// Each product is connected to a shop
ProductModel(
  id: 'food_1',
  shopId: 'shop_1',  // Connected to shop
  title: 'Butter Croissant',
  // ... other fields
)

// Shop provides all shop information
ShopModel(
  id: 'shop_1',
  name: 'Tandoori Tarang',
  deliveryTime: 'Delivery in 30-35 min',
  rating: 4.8,
  address: '123 Food Street, City',
  isOpen: true,
)
```
