# Home Feature Restructuring Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Organized Structure**

The home feature has been reorganized into a clean, feature-based structure:

```
lib/features/home/presentation/widgets/
â”œâ”€â”€ app_bar/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home_app_bar.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app_bar.dart (barrel file)
â”œâ”€â”€ banners/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ offer_banner.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ banners.dart (barrel file)
â”œâ”€â”€ categories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ categories_section.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ category_item.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ categories.dart (barrel file)
â”œâ”€â”€ products/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ product_item.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ product_section.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ products.dart (barrel file)
â”œâ”€â”€ search/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ search_bar.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.dart (barrel file)
â””â”€â”€ widgets.dart (main barrel file)
```

## ðŸ“¦ **Benefits of This Structure**

### 1. **Feature-Based Organization**

- Each widget group is organized by its functionality
- Easy to locate and maintain related components
- Scalable architecture for future growth

### 2. **Barrel Files (Index Files)**

- Clean imports using barrel files
- Import entire feature sets with single import
- Better developer experience

### 3. **Modular Design**

- Each feature folder can be used independently
- Easy to reuse components across different parts of the app
- Clear separation of concerns

## ðŸ”§ **How to Use**

### Import All Home Widgets:

```dart
import '../widgets/widgets.dart';
```

### Import Specific Feature:

```dart
import '../widgets/products/products.dart';  // All product widgets
import '../widgets/categories/categories.dart';  // All category widgets
```

### Import Individual Widget:

```dart
import '../widgets/products/product_item.dart';  // Single widget
```

## âœ… **Updated Features**

### 1. **Product Rating & Weight System**

- Added `rating` (double) and `weight` (String?) to ProductModel
- All products now have realistic ratings (4.2 - 4.9)
- Weight information for better product details
- Rating display with star icon in both ProductItem and YouMayLikeSection

### 2. **YouMayLikeSection Enhancements**

- Consistent UI with main product listings

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Improvements**

- Better product information hierarchy

This restructuring makes the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly while adding essential product features like ratings and weights.
